                <h1>How I stay commited to learning</h1>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.<span class="break">

                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</span></p>
                <h1>How i got started</h1>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.<span class="break">

                   That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</span>
